## Introduction

RecycleVision is an application developed as part of the SOEN 6751 HCI course. In this project, we aim to develop a mobile application that simplifies the process of waste sorting. The application will use visual cues and gamification to engage users and increase their confidence in waste disposal practices. It will also leverage image recognition technology to classify different types of waste, thereby reducing confusion and increasing accuracy in waste disposal.

## Features

The RecycleVision application offers the following features:

1. **Visual Cues for Waste Sorting**: The application uses visual cues to enhance user confidence and engagement in waste-sorting practices. This feature helps users to identify and sort waste correctly.

2. **Emotional Satisfaction**: The application is designed to impact the user's emotional response positively. It provides satisfaction to users by enabling them to dispose of waste effectively and correctly.

3. **Gamification of Waste Sorting**: The application incorporates gamification elements to encourage habitual correct waste sorting. This feature makes the waste sorting process more engaging and fun for users.

4. **Environmental Awareness**: The application aims to increase user's environmental awareness. It tracks the user's waste sorting practices before and after using the application, providing insights into their contribution to broader environmental practices.
